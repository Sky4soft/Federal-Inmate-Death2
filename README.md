# Federal Inmate Deaths Analysis

## Background
This repository contains data obtained by the [Data Liberation Project](https://www.data-liberation-project.org/), via a [Freedom of Information Act request](https://www.data-liberation-project.org/requests/ssvf-satisfaction-surveys/) to the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and pre-processed by the Data Liberation Project. The goal of this project is to explore patterns and trends in inmate deaths within the federal prison system, analyzing factors such as **death categories, demographic distributions, and geographic trends**.

## FOIA Records
The records provided by the VA by the Data Liberation Project can be viewed [HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VyoVX2PEQXSaUJ9dNTvJ36HNBE5tGLcy/edit?gid=1808560422#gid=1808560422).

## Code
This repository contains one Malloy code file:
- [`prison1.malloynb`](prison1.malloynb), which performs the analysis of the data provided by the Data Liberation Project.

## Motivation
Underatanding the causes and patterns of inmate deaths is essential for:
- Identifying preventable causes,
- Highlighting public health concerns in the prison system.
- Supporting transparency and accountability within federal institutions.
- Providing insights for policymakers and advocacy groups focused on prison reform.

## Summary of Findings

This dataset provides information on federal inmate deaths, including demographic details such as sex, race, and institution (InstID), along with the date of death (DOD), cause of death (DeathCategory), and ICD-10 codes for primary and secondary causes. The most common causes of death in this sample include Cancer, Cardiac conditions, Pulmonary diseases, Liver diseases, Hanging, and Drug Overdose. The data highlights racial and institutional distribution, with White and Black male inmates being the majority of reported deaths. Additionally, multiple institutions are represented, showing the widespread nature of inmate mortality across different facilities.

After analyzing the dataset, several key insights emerged:
- **Cardiac-related deaths** are the most common cause.
- The highest number of deaths occurred during the **COVID-19 pandemic (2020)**.
- Specific institutions consistently report higher death counts.
- The most common death categories are **Cardiac, Cancer, Pulmonary, Liver**, and **Unknown**.
- **Demographic patterns** reveal disparities across sex and race groups.

## Visualizations & Analysis  
This project leverages **Malloy** for querying and analyzing the data. Various visualizations, including **bar charts and line graphs**, are used to enhance data interpretation.  

Below are some key findings from the analysis, presented in a clear and easy-to-understand format.

2. This dataset provides insights into federal inmate deaths by institution, cause, and year, highlighting the facilities with the highest mortality rates and the most common causes of death. BUH (1,840 deaths) recorded the highest number of deaths, followed by SPG (578) and DEV (322), suggesting that certain institutions house higher-risk or terminally ill inmates. The leading causes of death include cardiac arrest (I46 - 344 deaths), liver cancer (C22 - 159 deaths), and colon cancer (C18 - 143 deaths). Suicide by hanging (X70 - 180 deaths) and COVID-19 (U07.1 - 266 deaths) also account for a significant portion of deaths. The presence of 477 deaths with unknown ICD-10 classifications (UNK) indicates possible gaps in cause-of-death reporting. This data underscores the health risks, chronic conditions, and systemic challenges contributing to mortality in the federal prison system.

3. This graph illustrates yearly inmate deaths from 2012 to 2023, categorized by Pulmonary, Cancer, Liver, and Unknown causes. Cancer-related deaths consistently remain the highest, followed by Pulmonary and Liver diseases, indicating that chronic illnesses are major contributors to inmate mortality. A significant spike in deaths occurred in 2020, likely due to COVID-19 and other health complications. The Unknown category suggests gaps in medical reporting or classification. Overall, the data highlights long-term health challenges in the prison system, emphasizing the need for improved medical care and disease prevention strategies.
