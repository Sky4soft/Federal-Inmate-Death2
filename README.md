# Federal Inmate Deaths Analysis

## Background
This repository contains data obtained by the [Data Liberation Project](https://www.data-liberation-project.org/), via a [Freedom of Information Act request](https://www.data-liberation-project.org/requests/ssvf-satisfaction-surveys/) to the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and pre-processed by the Data Liberation Project. The goal of this project is to explore patterns and trends in inmate deaths within the federal prison system, analyzing factors such as **death categories, demographic distributions, and geographic trends**.

## FOIA Records
The records provided by the VA by the Data Liberation Project can be viewed [HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VyoVX2PEQXSaUJ9dNTvJ36HNBE5tGLcy/edit?gid=1808560422#gid=1808560422).

## Code
This repository contains one Malloy code file:
- [`prison1.malloynb`](prison1.malloynb), which performs the analysis of the data provided by the Data Liberation Project.

## Motivation
Underatanding the causes and patterns of inmate deaths is essential for:
- Identifying preventable causes,
- Highlighting public health concerns in the prison system.
- Supporting transparency and accountability within federal institutions.
- Providing insights for policymakers and advocacy groups focused on prison reform.

## Summary of Findings
After analyzing the dataset, several key insights emerged:
- **Cardiac-related deaths** are the most common cause.
- The highest number of deaths occurred during the **COVID-19 pandemic (2020)**.
- Specific institutions consistently report higher death counts.
- The most common death categories are **Cardiac, Cancer, Pulmonary, Liver**, and **Unknown**.
- **Demographic patterns** reveal disparities across sex and race groups.

## Data Sources  
The dataset includes records of federal inmate deaths, providing details such as:  
- **Date of Death (DOD)**  
- **Cause of Death (ICD-10 Codes)**  
- **Demographics (Race, Sex, Age, Location)**  
- **Prison Facility (Institution ID, State, County)**  

## Datasets
- prison.csv: Primary dataset of inmate deaths.
- categories.csv: Category definitions for causes of death.
- Additional support files, such as locationplace.csv and wheretogo.csv are included for geospatial analysis.

## Data Cleaning Steps
To ensure reliable analysis, the following cleaning steps were performed:
- Removed records with incomplete or ambiguous dates.
- Standardized **ICD-10** codes to group causes of death.
- Cleaned and unified inconsistent **city, state**, and **institution ID** fields.
- Filled missing categories with `"Unknown"` to maintain data consistency.
- Filtered out invalid entries or duplicates in the dataset.

## Key Questions Explored  
- What are the most common causes of death in federal prisons?  
- Are certain causes of death more prevalent in specific locations or institutions?  
- How have inmate death rates changed over time?  
- Are there any observable patterns across demographic groups?  

## Visualizations & Analysis  
This project leverages **Malloy** for querying and analyzing the data. Various visualizations, including **bar charts, line graphs, and scatter plots**, are used to enhance data interpretation.  

This data shows the yearly trends in deaths from Cancer, Liver, Pulmonary, and Unknown causes across different cities and countries.
